# Plugin Slug
As it is asked to state explicty that what should be our slugname. So, the slug name we would prefere as `shipday-integration-for-woocommerce` and the plugin url would be then `wordpress.org/plugins/shipday-integration-for-woocommerce`

# Description
We permit plugins to require the use of 3rd party (i.e. external) services, provided they are properly documented in a clear manner.

We require plugins that reach out to other services to disclose this, in clear and plain language, so users are aware of where data is being sent. This allows them to ensure that any legal issues with data transmissions are covered. This is true even if you are the 3rd party service.

In order to do so, you must update your readme to do the following:

clearly explain that your plugin is relying on a 3rd party as a service and under what circumstances
provide a link to the service
provide a link to the servicesâ€™ a terms of use and/or privacy policies
