# Partner Payment Requirements
    - Radio button and payment optin add(both credit card and partner payment) are independent
      - if dispatcher select credit card radio option and want to add partner payment its possible (same for credit card as well)
    - After removing any payment option which is selected, shoudln't change the default payment option
      - if currently selected default option is credit card and we have both credit card and partner payment, if the dispatcher remove the credit card, there shouldn't be any change  in the default option(it shouldn't be changed to partner payment)
    - By Default the payment option should be CARD
## Issues
 - If no partner payment details given and default option selected is partner and the dispatcher has credit card also, should we give him facility to upgrade?
 - If no credit card details given and the default option selected is credit card and partner payment info given, then shoud we give him facility to upgrade?
 - If dispatcher add partner payment details and upgrade to professional then change the default option to credit card then how to charge in backend?
 - If upgraded with the default option crdit card and later change to default option partner payment and want to downgrade what will happen?
