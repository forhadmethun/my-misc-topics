### Botnet
- A botnet is a collection of devices that have been infected with a bot program which allows an attacker to control them.

- Attackers can plant bot programs on a device in many ways. One common method is to use an exploit kit hosted on a website to probe every site visitor's device for an exploitable flaw; if one is found, the kit silently downloads and installs the bot.
- Once the bot program is installed, it will usually try to contact a remote website or server where it can retrieve instructions. This site or server is known as the command-and-control or C&C server.The attacker controlling the botnet via its C&C server can be referred to as its botherder, botmaster, operator or controller.
- Botnet can do -
  - send out email and file
  - collect and forward data
  - monitor user's action
  - probe other connected device
  - download and run program
  - Launching DDos attacks on rival websites or services
  - Distributing spam emails or malware
  - Mining Digital Currencies
  - etc.
