On my first picture you can see the sky and some trees. I liked this picture a lot because it gives you a glance on Beaverton’s nature and weather. In Beaverton we have alot of rainy, moist and cold days. We also have a lot of nature here, which is one of the reasons why I like Beaverton a lot. On my second picture it shows some of the Christmas decorations people put out to show some christmas spirit. When I was walking around through some neighborhood’s, I would see a lot of christmas decorations and I personally love christmas, which is one of the reasons why I chosed this picture.
After taking a walk around Beaverton, I realised that Beaverton is much bigger and beautiful than I thought. When I was walking through downtown there was a lot of chaos, with cars and many people trying to get somewhere. But when we got to walk through the neighborhoods, everything seem so peaceful and calm.","{Appreciate, Community-related, ecological, sociological, Personal details, Extend, Elaborate/Explain, Other, Cross-Strand Example, Personal / Identity expression, Original Post, Share Info, Emotional expression, Notice}",

I took this photo because I thought that it is very interesting that there was a little bridge with water underneath. This little bridge is on 185th on the left side coming back from the big intersection of 185th and TV Hwy in Aloha Oregon. I want other people to notice that there is a water path that leads somewhere. Unfortunately I do not know where the water leads. While I was passing by this I received a smell of trees wet and the smell of nature. It was incredible. You could also hear the water running.  Also I want you to notice that the ground is wet. The ground is wet because It just stopped raining.,"{Appreciate, Elaborate/Explain, Reader / audience sensitivity, Storytelling, Community-related, ecological, sociological, Other, Notice, Cross-Strand Example, Original Post, Share Info, Coding question}",

First Picture: This picture represents an old traditional iraqi game, this games is drawn by chalk in the ground then you try to jump as much as you can without getting one foot wrong.

There is a wonderful view from the mountain, that shows the city.

The tree i posted is 200 years old! crazy i always had walked by this tree and had no clue that it was so old. The tree is beautiful and has been part of my town for so long, the fact that it still stands 200 years later is fascinating! The other picture is the whole group getting ready to walk into a forest in beaverton, which is rare because when do you see a forest in your town! It was so cool just walking through the nature with the students and looking at all that nature has to offer. It was unique and fun at the same time, people go on jogs, live next to and just explore the forest.

"During our walking tour I took these to photo to show because they have some history behind them when beaverton hardly existed. My first photo with the duplexes used to be all farmland for radishes as you can see there is also now public transportation which is the the max line much has changed over time. My second photo I chose because it also was part of farmland for radishes and as you see it is now a 24 hour fitness where you can exercise which is located next to the max line. On the other side of 24 hour fitness is a three story garage for customers to park their cars if they drive.
 I chose these photos because I wanted others to see how much of beavertons history has changed and what used to be there. I also want others to get an idea of how it would look like if we still had farmland instead of today’s generations buildings and technology. Think of yourself being on a farmland instead of a max line and duplexes with a 24 hour fitness across from you.
During our walking tour of beaverton I got to see many things I never knew that had a piece of history I got to see buildings that still existed from the 60’s. Walking at a 3 MPH speed made me feel like I was missing a lot about beaverton. I saw things that I never knew existed i saw forests that used to be beaver dams I saw houses that looked like a box there was so much history it made me change the way I see beaverton.

There were all different kinds of decorations on house lawns that i have never seen which was awesome to see the different minds of people.

The squirrels were friendly and my brother almost fed one, didn't work because the little squirrel was scared but it was a fun thing to see, especially in beaverton.
