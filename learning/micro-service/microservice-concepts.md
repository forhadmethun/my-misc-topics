microservices should be cohesive / loosely coupled 
## Decomposing microservice
 - decomposing by business capability
 - decomposing by subdomain
   - Bounded Context Pattern (DDD (domain driven design)) -> defines business as a domain
     - domains are required high co-operation
     - strategic and tactic DDD
     - grouping of closely related scopes 
     - logical bounderies have common business rules -> bounded context, self consistent & independent as possible 
   - domain consists of multiple subdomain
- Domain analysis to model microservice
  - Domain analysis -> bounded context (contains domain which consists of multipe subdomain) -> decompose strategies -> identify microservice boundaries 
- Unerstand a domain
  - requirement and modeling
  - identify user stories
  - identify nouns in user stories
  - identify verb in user stories
