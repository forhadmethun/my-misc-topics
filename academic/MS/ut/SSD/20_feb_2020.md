### Security Risk
#### Goal
 - security criteria, define security risk 
Business Asset: something valueable which is create value
    - data
    - information
    - services
    - some operations
#### Processing of Information
 - everything in IT reduce to 6 functions
    - Capturing information
    - Transmitted information  : goes from one unit to another unit : ex: arrow from one to another
        - email, wireless *
    - storing information : ex - create game
    - retrieving info: ex - nothing goes from this system
    - manipulating : ex - update, create game, simple input output
    - displaying : ex - assignment received
#### Practice 
    - [from business process write some/one example of each function for inofrmation processing to support fill the table](https://courses.cs.ut.ee/MTAT.03.307/2020_spring/uploads/Main/L03.pdf)
      - Info processing function 
        - capture information : game info received, submit game report
        - transmit information : submit game info -> game info received
        - store information : create game, update game report, update confirmation
        - retrieve information : nothing in this system as need to get something from storage device
        - manipulate information : update, create game,update confirmation
        - display information : assignment received, game created, game report registered

#### Functional Decomposition
 - potential path for certain action
   - user interface
   - data/storage management
   - resource management
   - distribution control 
   - communication
   - addressing 


### Risk Analysis
#### Threat Assets
#### Vulnerability
Seven Pernicious Kingdoms
    - 1. input validation
      - ex: airport keyboard outof bound
    - 2. API abuse
      - contract between request and response(caller and callee)
      - ex: fails chdir() after chroot()
      - result:
        - 
    - 3. Security Feature
      - do implement to make system secure
      - ex: cryptography, access control, digital signature, 
      - result:
        - insecure randomness
        - privacy 
        - missing access control
        - privacy violation
    - 4. Time and State
      - multithreading,
      - sharign resources
      - distributed computing
      - result;
        - deadlock
        - failure to begin a new session
        - insecure temporary file 
        - file access race condition
    - 5. Error Handling
      - error handling in api
      - result:
    - 6. Code Quality
      - 
    - 7. Encapsulation
      - lack of clear boundaries

    - * Environment
      - cased by
        - software
        - os
        - quality
      - resulting: 

#### Threat Agent 
 - using attack method
   - has means
   - has opportunity
 - has a motive
 - has the capability 

 - Characteristics of Threat agent
   - opportunity
     - hardware device
     - software component
     - database
     - communication link
   - motivation
     - curiosity : Vandal
     - personal fame

       - illegitimate
   - expertise
     - script kiddies
     - undergraduate
     - expert
     - specialist : Spy

##### Attack Method
 - what we could potentially do
 - different taxonomies how to characterize
STRIDE
##### Thread to distributed system
    - identity attack
      - attacker attempts to fabricate or misuse of identites of system
    - networking communication attacks
      - target communication
      - message secrecy
      - message integrity
      - ex: data need to be sent from input to server, data sent in plain text, attacker read/capture data and modify and send to the server
        - solution: secure communication
        - so we're finding in the design phase and modeling the solution
    - network protocol attack
    - passing illegal data
    - remote infoinference
    - loss of accountability
    - uncontroled operations
    - Threats to security infrastructure
      - cryptography attacks
      - countermeasure design
      - configuration/administration
      - network protocol threats

    - Bot
    - Bug
    - ransomeware
    - rootkit
    - virus
    - worm
    - torjan horse
    - spam
#### Risk
 - combination of previous things
   - thread agent exploiting vulnerability with threat agent .....
   - Risk
     - event
       - threat
         - threat agent
         - attack method
       - vulnerability
     - impact


##### Tasks: Elicit Security risks for the given example
    - System Asset: find risk of communication between 'security game report' to 'game report received'
      - identify system assets : communication between one to another
      - vulnerabilities: go through 7 kingdom
        - input data not validated
        - digital sig
      - threat agent:
        - query game report stage
      - threat
        - passing illegal 'game report'
      - impact
        - modify 'game report'
        - negation of 'game report' integrity
    - risk(aggregation of all components): script kiddie passes ilegal game report due to the lack of 'game report' validation at 'submit game report interface leading to negation of integrity of game report(modification of game report)


# Security Requirement
## Security Risk Management Domain Model 
    - Security Criteria
      - formulate what security needed
      - level
      - indicators to access signification of a risk
        - C
        - I
          - Accuracy
          - Completeness
        - A
    - Security requirement
      - condition need to be fulfilled to make system security
      - what level security need to be reached
        - different from security objective(criteria)
        - different from choice of securit chontrols(design)
      - What are requirements?
        - Application domain
        - Machine domain

        - ex: auto light with the intensity with light

      - Domain Properties
      - Requirement

        - repudiate
        - confidential
        - bla bla bla
      - Classification of Security requirements
        - identification

          - secure port
        - System maintenance security requirements
      - Specification of Security requirements
        - what are criteria for writing good requirement
          - avoid Ambigious 
            - remove the word 'or'
          - avoid multiple requirement
            - and, or, with, also
          - avoid let-out clauses
            - if, when, except, unless, although, always
          - long rumbbling sentences
          - Speculation: do not usually generally, often normally, typically
          - vauge, identified terms : zero adjective
            - user-friendly, verstile, approximately, as possible, efficient, improved, high-performance, modern
              - versatile, user-friendly
              - as soon as possible
          - wishful thinking   
            - 100% secure
            - all unexpected error
          - avoid system design
            - we ask what to make, not how!!
            - so hide system design info. 
          - avoid system design elements
            - identification requirement
              - who you say you are
              - what you have
              - who you are
            - authorisation
            - integrity
        - Good Requirement
          - write simple direct sentences
            - what you do
          - use limited vocabulary
            - use change instead of reconfigure
          - identify users
          - focus on stating result
          - define verifiable criteria
              - validation; origin, verification: looks the system 
        - Criteria from writing good requirement
          - what it should do
          - understandble, clarity, not ambigious
          - cohesiveness
            - on thing at a time
          - testability

# Security Matrix
## Asset related concepts
    - Business asset
    - IS asset
## Risk related concept
 - risk
 - impact
 - event
 - vulnerability
 - threat
 - threat agent
 - attack method

## Measuring Risk
 - likelihood
 - level of vulnerability
 - potentiality of event = likelihood + vulnerability level - 1

## Risk Treatment
### Measuring risk treatment

## Case of Airline Turnaround
 - check in passenger info
 - lluggage
 - fuel slip
 - cargo assifne
 - risk reduction level


 - if you do not measure, you do no control!!!!
