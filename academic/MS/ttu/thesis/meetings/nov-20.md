binary classification

normal
	other
	
	
we can also use
	multi class 
		10 classes in that case 
		
		
feature - 47 
	flow info,
		src ip, port dest ip, port, transaction protocol 
	info about the flow
		how many bytes coming from src to dest
		- they are collecting bidirectional 
		others info
			how many packet drops
			Data type:
				- int
				- float
				- nominal
					- about the protocol 
					
** 					integerfor learning basically 
*** it would be nice to use *nominal* 
	- woulbe be helpful for the learning model 
	- prevous study they excluded but in our study we'll include 
	
	
	tcp - sequence
		- some numbers are unique
	dtcpb
		- some unique
			=> eliminate those** 
			
			
	- Other time feature
		- may be used 
			- for some
			 characterization
			 
	- some boolean data
		- can use *
		
		
	- should remove src, dest ip adress 
		as for specific purpose
		
		
		timing -> exactly can't chracterize always
			stime, ltime -> treat special way 
			sequence number -> treat special way
				may not be applided to other data
				
				
				
 --> we can use data from link or cross validate
 	-> there are some sub caterogies -> more detailed -> this is not so critical 
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 -> first familiar with dataset -> easy!!
 -> takes some dataset-> make some sample
 	-> traintest split or some other 
 	-> following
 		-> try to plot each plot individually => some 
 			- How they vary
 		-> cross validate manner do -> fisher score
 			-> numeric value er khetre eta use kori amra
 			
 	
 			
  -> categorically integer ** 		
  
  
  
  feature selection
  	-> Gini Index & Entropy 
  		-> AGrawal book's 
  		
  		basically we have categorical data	
  			- complicated life
  		<GINI & ENTROPY> on the data set , similar like fisher score 
  			-> 
  			-> categorical data* 
  		then we'll discuss
