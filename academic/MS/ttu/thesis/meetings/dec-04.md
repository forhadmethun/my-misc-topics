fisher score: 
 - 
 
 1st part:
 ---------
 
semi - supervisoed / active learning
	- simply see what is happening
			- make feature selection
					- numer featuer : fisher score
					
					
			1. 			
					
					- plot graph with score
					
					
					how many feature has more FS and less
					more to less 
					
					
					-> some feature, whcih has more fisher score
					
				- trying to cs(classification)
				
		2. 		
				knn
				decision tree
				svm
				logistic regression
		3.		
				with some sample of data
				
				
		4. how many features we would select?
		
2nd step:
	gini index, entropy		
		
		claustering** 
		k - means
		density based
		
		
		to seeif clustering assumpation is holds
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
---------------------------------------	 ** ---------------------------------------------------	
		
		
=> first task
	-> take fisher score, select variable plot them properly
	-> selected number of variable
		-> first two then performance of model poor
		-> then three
		
		then ultimately 0.9
		
		
		
	parrel task:
		take fisher score
			select few variable
				which has good discriminabiltiy to 
				
	k - mean, hierarchical/density based -> clustering

semi supervised & active:

prerequisite tools: 
	minifiluded(minifold0 assumption
		-> difficult to verify(maybe january / february)
		
	clustering assumption -> gini index, and entropy
	Continutiy assumption -> simple to verify
	
	problem in our case: 
		none of our assumption will satisfy with 100%
		-> we'll evaluate performance of the algorithm
	
	
	


supervisde -> labelled dataset -> classifier -> gives machine -> 
new data ->  machine -> predicts

small data set -> to train -> (classifier will train) 
	-> sometimes day i know and sometimes don't know
	then send ti to oracle 
		-> gives a lebel and go to the first step again 


=> how our machine will work with our assumption 
=> oracle: part of or dataset

-> what happens if oracle is wrong



-> SOC: 
	1st -> retrieve case 
	, 2nd
