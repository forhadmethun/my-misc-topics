# Functional Programming
- immutability 
- concise and readable code
- function's as first class citizen
```java
Function<String, String> addSomeString = (name) -> name.toUpperCAse().concat("default"); 
```
- declarative code 
    - what result you want
    - immutability
    - analogous to sql
    - make use of functions 
    - functional programming uses this approach
